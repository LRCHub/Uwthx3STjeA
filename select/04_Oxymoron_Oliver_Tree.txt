When you say something
But you really mean something else
When you're staring in the mirror
And don't recognize yourself
We are oxymorons
To be human is a paradox
Your split personality
And every contradicting thought
You can't see the irony but I can
You can't tell there's parallels but I can
Well, you're damned if you don't and you're damned if you do
My whole life feels like a catch 22
Caught in a hard place, it's so hard to see
I'm clearly confused, life's so bittersweet
We are oxymorons
To be human is a paradox
Your split personality
And every contradicting thought
You can't see the irony but I can
You can't tell there's parallels but I can
Your empty hollow head
Is still filled up full with rubbish
Well, the wisest man once said
I know one thing, I know nothing
But we all need to risk something
'Cause if you risk nothing at all
Then you have to run the risk of
Never getting what you want
Well, you can't see the irony but I can
You can't tell there's parallels but I can
You can't see the irony but I can
You can't tell there's parallels but I can
