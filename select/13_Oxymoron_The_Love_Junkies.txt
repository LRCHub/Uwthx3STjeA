Can't put a name to my face
So go take me to the place
I feel nothing at all
Fix me up, watch me crawl

Well, these things they go Wooh, yeah
The little things they go Wooh, yeah
Well, these things they go...

Well the drugs keep me fed
I'm just a loser in your bed
So make the best of what's left

Well these things they go Wooh, yeah
The little things they go Wooh, yeah
Well all the things they go Wooh, yeah
Well the things they go Wooh, yeah
Well the things they go...

What, I'm an asshole
What, I'm an asshole
What, I'm an asshole
What?

Well these things they go Wooh, yeah
The little things they go Wooh, yeah
Well all the things they go Wooh, yeah
Well the things they go Wooh, yeah
Well the things they go

Then go take me to the place
